Learning about projective geometry by playing with 4-dimensional objects

An outline of how this might work: 

[] Build a representation of a tesseract and how it rotates
[] Project the tesseract onto an affine 3-plane behind it 
[] Render the resulting projection


Other thoughts:
* If one shades the 2-sphere along a diameter, then 
  the projection of the 2-sphere onto a 2-plane is a circle shaded
  along that axis. Similarly, if one shades a 3-sphere along a diameter
  (WOLOG the *u*-axis) then it's projection into 3-space will be a 
  2-ball shaded along an axis. One can perhaps usefully extend this to 
  a cube.
